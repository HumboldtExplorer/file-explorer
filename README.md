## Known Issues/Suggested Improvements

- Add Jest tests to verify components are rendering correctly
- Add loading component to display while data is loading
- Add error component to display if API returns an error
- Some components are sharing duplicated code, could be refactored to be more generic
- Components such as Breadcrumbs or Sidebar could be refactored to render any data that adheres to a given interface, rather than being specific to FilExplorerFile objects. E.g.: "Page" objects

### Code style
- Prefix interfaces with I as per common style preferences
- Use arrow functions instead of function keyword 

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
